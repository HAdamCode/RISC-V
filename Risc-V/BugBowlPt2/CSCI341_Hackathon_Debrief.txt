2) First we ran the program to see where the code threw errors
	which is how we found most of the errors. The last two
	errors were found by running the code step by step
	to see where the numbers were getting lost. One of the
	bugs was an endless loop so we went through and found
	the iterator to make sure it was being updated. Another
	was missing a return address which was the easiest and
	first mistake we found.

3) PseudoCode:

void func(vector<int> vec) {
	sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
	int sum = 0;
	for (auto i : vec) {
		sum += i;
		cout << vec << " ";
	}
	cout << endl;
	cout << sum/vec.size();
}

4) We spent about 1.5 hours

5) We did not seek out any help

6) We were pleased with how quickly we were able to solve all the
	bugs. This was a really fun challenge.
