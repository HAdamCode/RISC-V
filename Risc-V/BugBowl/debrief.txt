1) Just myself: Hunter Adam

2) 2.5 hours

3) No help needed

4) I made sure to read the instructions multiple times.
	I also made an effort to test all edge cases
	mostly focused on the zeros and how they 
	might break my code.

5) I do not have any issues that I have seen with my code yet
	I do wish it was slightly more complex.

6) I am most pleased with two aspects of the code. 

	This first is that instead of just using mul
	in my rectangle function, I instead used a for
	loop to add up the first number, second number of
	times.

	The second is that I ended up multiplying 3.14
	by 100 and my r^2 by 100 to get rid of decimals 
	and keep more precision. This will also hopefully
	confuse the people looking at the code.
